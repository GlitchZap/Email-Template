# Email Template Repository

Welcome to the **Email Template** repository! This project provides a collection of customizable email templates designed for various use cases. These templates are built using HTML and CSS, making them compatible with most email clients.

## Features

- **Customizable**: Easy to modify text, images, and styles to fit your needs.
- **Inline CSS**: Ensures better compatibility with email clients that strip external stylesheets.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use or modify these templates, you'll need:

- A basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GlitchZap/Email-Template.git

2. Choose the template that fits your needs and open the corresponding .html file in your preferred code editor.

3. Customize the template by replacing placeholder text, images, and modifying styles as needed.

4. Once you're done, copy the HTML content and paste it into your email service provider's HTML editor (e.g., Mailchimp, SendGrid).

### Inline CSS
To ensure that your styles are preserved across all email clients, it's recommended to inline the CSS. You can use an online tool like Premailer to inline the styles automatically.

## Preview
To preview the templates, you can simply open the .html files in your browser.
